# cree
A application similar to the `tree` command in Linux/Unix that displays the structure of files and folders in a tree format. with the difference that in `cree`, the number of lines in text files is also displayed next to them. In fact, itâ€™s a combination of the `wc -l` and `cat` commands for text files!
